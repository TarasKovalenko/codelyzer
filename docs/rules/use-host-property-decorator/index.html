description: Use @HostProperty decorator rather than the `host` property of `@Component` and `@Directive` metadata.
descriptionDetails: 'See more at https://angular.io/styleguide#style-06-03.'
options: null
optionsDescription: Not configurable.
rationale: |-

  The property associated with @HostBinding or the method associated with @HostListener
  can be modified only in a single place: in the directive's class. If you use the host metadata
  property, you must modify both the property declaration inside the controller, and the metadata
  associated with the directive.
